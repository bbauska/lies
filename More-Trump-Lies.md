<h1>Trump Lies 1st year of 2nd term = 2025-Jan 9th to Dec 31st.
These aren't just sycophants. These are fucking retards. Retarded in every intelligent way. Fucking 
retards. Like Trump's ass-hole children. Fucking 'tards. Witcoff, 

1) Susie Wiles: Chief of staff and queen of Trump world
	Why she matters
	Trump trusts her completely and, importantly, she has widespread respect among the various
	MAGA-world factions. She ran by far the most professional of his three campaigns for the 
	White House. Wiles tries to control the chaos around Trump, but never tries to control him 
	— a point that has preserved her space in his orbit.

	What she wants
	Wiles has been empowered as gatekeeper and wants to execute on that in an environment that 
	will present many more challenges than the campaign. She eschews the spotlight but 
	judiciously wields the sword. She also wants to survive, a goal that eluded her 
	predecessors
2) Stephen Miller: Deputy chief of staff for policy and architect of Trump’s immigration policies
	Why he matters
	Miller, who was instrumental in shaping Trump’s “America First” agenda, is even more empowered
	now. He is the brains behind all things immigration — from sealing the border to mass
	deportations. Miller, who represents the ideological core of Trumpism, has a massive portfolio
	beyond immigration. He’s also one of the few people among the core staff in Trump’s second term
	who has done this before and knows how the White House works.

	What he wants
	Miller, a true believer, wants to push the president’s nationalist, populist agenda as far as 
	he can.

3) Steve Witkoff: Special envoy to the Middle East. Billionaire real estate developer, donor and longtime Trump friend.

Why he matters
He is Trump’s golf buddy — and their drive down the fairway goes back to the 1980s. Trump is open to his counsel and, given how long a round of golf can go, he gets plenty of time to bend Trump’s ear. His tight bond with Trump empowers him in his official role and beyond. And despite the recent multiphase cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, the task ahead remains daunting.

4) Karoline Leavitt: The new, and at 27 the youngest ever, White House press secretary
Why she matters
Leavitt, who worked in the last Trump White House as an assistant press secretary, has in the last two years proved herself to be one of the president’s toughest and most nimble communicators, making the rounds on cable to tout and defend his agenda as national press secretary. It’s a skill that’ll come in handy as she faces tough questions from reporters in the briefing room. But she’s known for her amiability, too — another skill that’ll come in handy with this job.

What she wants
To avoid the fate of Sean Spicer, who did not last long and lost credibility with the public after he defended Trump’s falsehoods.

5) James Blair: Deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs. He was political director on the campaign and at the Republican National Committee.
	Why he matters
	He’s another Florida man who helped Wiles win the state for Trump in 2020. He’s one of the people she heavily relies on. He’ll be coordinating all the people working to execute Trump’s agenda and will be deeply in the know about what’s driving the day in the Oval. During the campaign, he was almost always in the room and, for now, that’s likely to remain the case.

	What he wants
	He’s a true believer. His ideology and vibe matches MAGA.

6) Taylor Budowich: Deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel. He ran Trump’s 2024 super PAC.
Why he matters
He impressed as Donald Trump Jr.’s gatekeeper in 2020, and Wiles took him under her wing. He’s now one of Wiles’ guys and Trump likes him. Plus, anyone who has Trump Jr.’s trust will have serious juice. He’s taking over one of the most coveted offices in the West Wing, usually reserved for the press secretary, a sign that he’s willing to use his muscle.

What he wants
Proximity and survival.

7) Vince Haley: Director of the Domestic Policy Council, where he will head up the president’s domestic policy agenda.
Why he matters
You’ll never see him but you’ll hear his words read off the prompter, his policies in executive orders and his political philosophy injected throughout the administration. Few people are more behind the scenes than Wiles but Haley, who worked for 12 years for former Speaker Newt Gingrich, is one of them. He is trusted, respected and heard.

What he wants
For Trump to stay on the prompter. Good luck with that!

8) Natalie Harp: 
Trump’s aide and “human printer”
Why she matters
The former far-right cable news anchor is now gatekeeper Numero Uno. She’s always with Trump. She gained the “human printer” moniker because she literally carries around a printer in a backpack so she’s able to print hardcopies — Trump’s preferred medium — of reading material. If you want to get to Trump or get information to Trump, you go through Harp. She has long been the conduit for the flow of news, sometimes to the chagrin of others.

What she wants
To loyally serve Trump, who she credits with saving her life. A 2018 law Trump enacted allowed her to access an experimental treatment for bone cancer.

9) Keith Kellogg: Special envoy for Ukraine and Russia and a decorated retired three-star general

Why he matters
Kellogg will be the central figure to help Trump handle the war in Ukraine. But that’s not the only reason he’s important. He’s been with Trump since 2015, from the moment he came down the golden escalator. He went to Pence world at the direction of Trump. He has been a regular fixture at Mar-a-Lago, even in the off-years. Trump may have his teams on military and foreign policy, but he’ll likely be calling up the general for his take on it all.

10) James Braid: Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, the top liaison between the White House and Capitol Hill
Why he matters
Braid is a longtime Hill staffer and close JD Vance ally, serving as his top policy staffer in the Senate. He worked in legislative affairs at the Office of Management and Budget during the first administration. And he has a major task ahead of him — navigating reconciliation.

11) Sergio Gor: 
Director of the Presidential Personnel Office, tasked with the monumental job of installing thousands of political appointees across the administration.
Why he matters
His job isn’t sexy, but he will have a crucial impact on Trump’s plans to install loyalists in key positions. Gor is perhaps one of the most colorful, amusing and well-liked characters in Trump’s orbit. He co-founded a publishing company with Trump Jr. that has produced several of the elder Trump’s books — and has DJ’ed MAGA parties across Palm Beach for the last four years.
Also

12) Donald Trump Jr: Trump’s eldest son
Why he matters
He’s the most involved of Trump’s five children. Trump Jr. appears to love — and want to take on — his father’s MAGA cause. He’s not taking an official role but will be talking to his father regularly and sharing his input on just about everything. If he wants someone out, they’ll probably be out. If he wants someone in, they’ll probably be in. (Vance, Trump’s heir-apparent, can for instance thank Trump Jr. for helping make him vice president.)

What he wants
His father’s confidence.

He overstated the “carnage” he was inheriting, then later exaggerated his “massive” crowd and 
claimed, despite clear evidence to the contrary, that it had not rained during his address. He 
repeated the rain claim the next day, along with the fabricated notion that he held the “all-time 
record” for appearing on the cover of Time magazine.

And so it went, day after day, week after week, claim after claim, from the most mundane of topics 
to the most pressing issues.

Over time, Trump unleashed his falsehoods with increasing frequency and ferocity, often by the 
scores in a single campaign speech or tweetstorm. What began as a relative trickle of 
misrepresentations, including 10 on his first day and five on the second, built into a torrent 
through Trump’s final days as he frenetically spread wild theories that the coronavirus pandemic 
would disappear “like a miracle” and that the presidential election had been stolen — the claim 
that inspired Trump supporters to attack Congress on Jan. 6 and prompted his second impeachment.

The final tally of Trump’s presidency: 30,573 false or misleading claims — with nearly half 
coming in his final year.

Read and search the full database of Trump’s false or misleading claims

For more than 10 years, The Fact Checker has assessed the accuracy of claims made by politicians 
in both parties, and that practice will continue. But Trump, with his unusually flagrant disregard 
for facts, posed a new challenge, as so many of his claims did not merit full-fledged fact checks. 
What started as a weekly feature — “What Trump got wrong on Twitter this week” — turned into a 
project for Trump’s first 100 days. Then, in response to reader requests, the Trump database was 
maintained for four years, despite the increasing burden of keeping it up.

The database became an untruth tracker for the ages, widely cited around the world as a measuring 
stick of Trump’s presidency — and as of noon Wednesday it was officially retired.

Whether such a tracker will be necessary for future presidents is unclear. Nonetheless, the impact 
of Trump’s rhetoric may reverberate for years.

“As a result of Trump’s constant lying through the presidential megaphone, more Americans are 
skeptical of genuine facts than ever before,” presidential historian Michael Beschloss said.

had made more than 2,500 false or misleading claims related to the virus.

An assessment of the Fact Checker database shows the dramatic escalation in the rate of Trump’s 
dishonesty over time. Trump averaged about six claims a day in his first year as president, 16 
claims day in his second year, 22 claims day in his third year — and 39 claims a day in his final 
year. Put another way, it took him 27 months to reach 10,000 claims and another 14 months to reach 
20,000. He then exceeded the 30,000 mark less than five months later.

Trump made false claims about just about everything, big and small, so the Fact Checker database 
provides a window into his obsessions (and the news cycle) at the time. When he felt under siege 
or in trouble, he responded by trying to craft an alternative reality for his supporters — and to 
viciously attack his foes. Nearly half of the false claims were communicated at his campaign 
rallies or via his now-suspended Twitter account.

Claims about immigration spiked just before the 2018 midterm elections, as Trump unsuccessfully 
tried to keep the House of Representatives in GOP hands with exaggerated claims about “caravans” 
of undocumented immigrants approaching the border. Then in late 2019 he responded to the uproar 
over a phone call in which he urged Ukraine’s president to announce an investigation of former 
vice president Joe Biden with more than 1,000 false and misleading claims on the issue in just 
four months.

False and misleading claims about the coronavirus pandemic emerged in 2020, so that by year’s 
end he had made more than 2,500 coronavirus-related claims — more than all of his trade claims 
over four years, even though trade has been one of the animating features of his presidency. 
Trump touted phony metrics to claim he successfully defeated the virus, pitched ineffective 
“cures” and constantly attacked former president Barack Obama for alleged failures, such as 
leaving a “bare cupboard” of ventilators (there were almost 17,000) and bungling the response 
to the swine flu pandemic in 2009-2010 (the response was considered a success).

In October, Trump was largely quiet for six days as he recovered from his own bout with covid-19. 
But even so, he made nearly 4,000 false or misleading claims that month, an average of 150 a day 
on the days he was not ill.

In speech after speech, he laid the groundwork for challenging the election, making baseless 
claims of potential election fraud, while attacking Biden as a mental incompetent — and a 
“grimy, sleazy and corrupt career politician” — who could not possibly emerge as the victor.

“It’s going to be a fraud,” Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News a month before voters went to the 
polls. “This is a terrible thing that’s happening to our country.”

After his election defeat, Trump spoke or tweeted about little except to offer lies about a stolen 
election, even as he or his supporters lost more than 60 court cases as judges repeatedly rejected 
his claims as bogus. After Nov. 3, he made more than 800 false or misleading claims about election 
fraud, including 76 times offering some variation of “rigged election.”

At his Jan. 6 speech at the Ellipse, in which he incited the attack on the Capitol, Trump made 107 
false or misleading claims, almost all about the election.

The aftermath of what Biden and other Democrats now call the “big lie” hovers over Washington as 
both parties figure out whether there can be a return to a shared set of facts undergirding 
national debate, or whether one of the major political parties will remain captive to the sorts 
of conspiracy theories that marked so many of Trump’s final year of claims.

The events of Trump’s final weeks demonstrated the extent to which his alternate reality became 
woven into the fabric of the Republican Party, with the majority of GOP lawmakers voting against 
certifying Biden’s victory even after the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol.

One hallmark of Trump’s fibs was his willingness to constantly repeat the same claims, no matter 
how often they had been debunked. One-fifth of his nearly 2,500 claims about the economy was the 
same falsehood — that he was responsible for creating the greatest economy in U.S. history. After 
the coronavirus outbreak tanked the economy, he amped up the rhetoric to say he had created the 
greatest economy in world history. Neither claim is true; under just about every metric, Dwight 
D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton had more robust economies during their 
presidencies. Even before the pandemic, Trump’s economy was already faltering because of his 
trade wars, with the manufacturing sector in a technical recession.


During his presidency, Trump made nearly 2,500 false or misleading claims about the economy. 
(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Nearly 300 times Trump falsely said that he passed the biggest tax cut in history. Even before his 
tax cut was crafted, he promised that it would be the biggest in U.S. history — bigger than 
President Ronald Reagan’s in 1981. Reagan’s tax cut amounted to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic 
product, and none of the proposals under consideration came close to that level. Yet Trump 
persisted in this fiction even when the tax cut was eventually crafted to be the equivalent of 
0.9 percent of the gross domestic product, making it the eighth-largest tax cut in 100 years. 

Trump’s penchant for repeating false claims is demonstrated by the fact that the Fact Checker 
database has recorded about 750 instances in which he has repeated a variation of the same claim 
at least three times.

The Fact Checker also tracked Three- or Four-Pinocchio claims that Trump has said at least 20 
times, earning him a Bottomless Pinocchio. Trump completed his term with 56 of those entries, 
including three — about the “rigged election,” allegations that Dominion voting machines changed 
votes and the falsehood that GOP poll watchers were denied access to vote-counting — that only 
emerged in the final months of his presidency.

The Bottomless Pinocchio list gives a rough approximation of the types of major falsehoods Trump 
said during his presidency. Roughly 25 percent exaggerated about his accomplishments, and 15 
percent misled about his policies. Another 15 percent dissembled about the Russia investigation 
or the probe into the Ukraine phone call. Roughly 10 percent each were fibs made out of whole 
cloth, attacks on people he considered foes, falsehoods about the coronavirus, phony claims 
about the election, or false statements about Biden and his proposals.

As the 2020 election neared, Trump nearly 50 times falsely reassured his supporters that Mexico 
was footing the $15 billion bill for his barrier along the southern border. U.S. taxpayers are 
paying, mostly via money Trump diverted from authorized military construction projects. This was 
perhaps Trump’s most famous campaign promise — during the 2016 campaign, he said more than 200 
times that Mexico would pay for the wall — so he simply pretended he had fulfilled it in an 
effort to reassure his base that he had succeeded.

Many repeated claims just barely missed the cutoff for a Bottomless Pinocchio, such as the claim 
that he repealed a provision of the U.S. tax code that prohibits religious organizations from 
endorsing or opposing political candidates. (All he did was issue a toothless executive order, 
but he obviously thought it was so important to evangelical groups that he falsely claimed he 
achieved one of their key political objectives.)


Rain falls at the White House on Nov. 30. One of Trump’s false claims early on as president was 
when he disputed that it rained during his inauguration. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Trump rarely abandons his falsehoods, so as he neared the end of his presidency his campaign 
rallies became longer and longer. Each speech had a familiar pattern. He would cycle through 
various grievances about the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and the 
impeachment over his Ukraine call. He trashed Obama, various Democrats and of course Biden. 
He falsely extolled his achievements in trade, foreign policy, the economy and immigration. 
He offered false assurances about the pandemic and warned darkly about fraud in the upcoming 
election.

The growth of falsehoods over the course of Trump’s presidency is illustrated by one remarkable 
statistic.

The Fact Checker team recorded 492 suspect claims in Trump’s first 100 days. Just on Nov. 2, the 
day before the 2020 election, Trump made 503 false or misleading claims as he barnstormed across 
the country in a desperate effort to save his presidency.

The database website has a search engine that will quickly locate suspect statements made by 
Trump. Readers can also isolate claims by time period, subject or venue.

Maintaining the database over four years required detailed examination of every Trump speech, 
news conference, press gaggle, campaign rally and interview, as well as more than 25,000 tweets. 
The fact checks of Trump’s statements in the database amount to about 5 million words.

The database includes any statement that might merit two or more Pinocchios under The Fact 
Checker’s rating scale. Trump often would repeat the same falsehood two or more times in a 
speech but only one instance of a claim per venue would be counted. The database did not 
include Facebook posts because they were often duplicative of tweets and likely staff-generated. 
The tally also generally did not count retweets, except for retweets of false or misleading videos.




Last week, Trump officials reportedly left behind documents describing confidential planning for the Trump-Putin meeting in a public area of an Alaskan hotel.

That’s nothing compared with the actions of Emil Bove, Trump’s new nominee for the US court of appeals for the third circuit, who reputedly told subordinates at the Department of Justice that they should “consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’” and ignoring any court order blocking a planned deportation flight.

Then there’s Billy Long, a former auctioneer and Republican congressman who Trump nominated and was confirmed less than two months ago to head the Internal Revenue Service, with “little background in tax policy beyond promoting a fraud-riddled tax credit”. Long has already been fired after clashing with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Long was the sixth person to head the IRS this year.

Let’s not forget EJ Antoni, whom Trump just nominated to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after firing former chief Erika McEntarfer for presiding over a disappointing jobs report earlier this month.

Antoni is that rarity who has drawn harsh criticism from economists on the right as well as the mainstream for being ignorant, unprincipled and incompetent. He recently celebrated that “all net job growth over the last year went to native-born Americans”.

I haven’t even mentioned the towering ineptitude of Trump’s cabinet picks, such as Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Robert F Kennedy Jr and Kristi Noem.

How to explain the rise of so many incompetent and unprincipled people?

Easy. They could never succeed on their own merits. As soon as their incompetence became apparent – which was likely to be as soon as they took the first job that required some degree of intelligence and integrity – they were fired.

So they learned that to be rewarded with promotions, money and power, they cannot rely on the normal processes and systems of recognition for jobs well done. If they’re to make anything of themselves, they must instead become ass-lickers, lap dogs and sycophants.

They must latch on to someone who values loyalty above integrity or competence, someone for whom fawning obsequiousness is the most important criterion for being hired and promoted, ideally someone who cannot tell the difference between a groveling toady and a knowledgeable adviser.

Enter Trump.

History is strewn with the wreckage of dictatorships that have attracted and promoted incompetent people lacking talent or integrity. As Hannah Arendt explained in her classic The Origins of Totalitarianism:

Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.

Early in his career, Trump apprenticed himself to Roy Cohn, an unprincipled lawyer who taught the young Trump how to gain wealth and influence through ruthless bullying, profane braggadocio, opportunistic bigotry, baseless lawsuits, lying, and more lying.

Yet as Trump’s “fixer” with politicians, judges and mob bosses, Cohn remained utterly loyal to Trump and his father, Fred.

Years later, in his book The Art of the Deal, Trump drew a distinction between integrity and loyalty. He preferred the latter, and for him, Cohn exemplified it. Trump contrasted Cohn with:

all the hundreds of ‘respectable’ guys who made careers out of boasting about their uncompromising integrity but have absolutely no loyalty … What I liked most about Roy Cohn was that he would do just the opposite.

Cohn died a disgrace, disbarred by the New York State Bar for unethical conduct after attempting to defraud a dying client by forcing him to sign a will amendment leaving Cohn his fortune.

People who climb upward by sacrificing their integrity to slavish subservience almost always fall on their faces eventually. Blind ambition trips them up. They cannot explain or defend their behavior by relying on principled competence because, like Cohn, they are unprincipled and incompetent to their cores.

The people they latch onto meet similar fates but for a different reason.

Leaders who value loyalty above all else find themselves surrounded by sycophantic crackpots and fools. As a result, they receive no objective or useful feedback about their actions – no warnings beforehand and no criticism afterward. All they get are commendations – “Wonderful idea, sir!” “Brilliant execution, sir!”

These cocoons of flattery seal off such leaders from the real-world consequences of what they do – which inevitably leads them to make grave mistakes. Some of those mistakes eventually cause their downfalls.

This perverse symmetry – the certain demise of grovelers because they’re incompetent and unprincipled and the inevitable downfall of those to whom they grovel because they never get useful and truthful feedback – marks the path of all totalitarian systems. It’s the path on which Trump now treads.

This is not necessarily cause for hope. If history is any guide, many innocent people suffer before the incompetent grovelers and the vain objects of their groveling meet their inevitable fates. America and the world are already suffering.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one. 

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.
