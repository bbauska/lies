Donald Trump's Dishonesty Has Reached New Depths

June 28, 2025

Dear Friends,

Five months into Donald Trump’s second term, one thing has become clear: dishonesty is the hallmark 
of his administration. On every issue — from health care and food assistance to foreign policy — 
Trump and his GOP allies in Congress have made promises they never intended to keep. Now, with our 
nation inching toward another catastrophic war in the Middle East and Republicans pushing a cruel 
budget that guts earned benefits for millions, more and more Americans are realizing the truth: 
Trump and his cronies cannot be trusted to look out for our best interests. This week brought new 
and alarming examples of that deceit.

When Donald Trump took office in January, he pledged to be “a peacemaker and unifier” on the world 
stage. But last weekend, he broke that promise by launching unauthorized airstrikes against Iran — 
an illegal act of war that bypassed Congress and risks plunging the United States into yet another 
prolonged Middle East conflict. While Trump insisted that the strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear 
facilities, the Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that they had set the program back by no more 
than a few months — raising the likelihood of drawn-out warfare and long-term regional instability.

The American people have made it abundantly clear: they don’t want another war of choice in the 
Middle East. Congress must act immediately by passing a bipartisan War Powers Act resolution to 
contain the fallout, prevent further escalation, and reassert its constitutional authority over 
matters of war and peace. Trump promised to end the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, between 
Israel and Hamas, and across the broader Middle East. On all accounts, he has failed.

Donald Trump and his allies also promised to “love and cherish” Medicare and Medicaid, 
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/politics/mike-johnson-speaker-medicaid-trump-agenda">
vowing repeatedly</a> that no one would lose their coverage and that only “waste, fraud, and 
abuse” would be cut. But these were more bald-faced lies. Last month, the House passed Trump’s 
so-called “big, beautiful bill” — a 
<a href="https://tonko.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4385">reckless budget 
scheme</a> that the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says would 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1KJqkdGHF9/">strip health coverage</a> from 16 million 
Americans. Now, Senate Republicans are clamoring to make Trump’s bill even uglier — with steeper 
cuts that will leave more kids, parents, and seniors without health care so they can reward their 
billionaire donors with even bigger tax breaks.

Despite their excuses and spin, Republicans know exactly how devastating their budget will be for 
millions of families. Yet even as they 
<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook-pm/2025/06/06/jessica-ramos-for-andrew-cuomo-endorsement-mayor-00392295">
scramble</a> to walk back some of the worst provisions of the bill they supported, GOP lawmakers 
have shown nothing but contempt for the everyday Americans pleading with them to consider the 
devastating consequences of this legislation.

When one constituent told Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) at a town hall meeting that people would die 
due to Republicans’ Medicaid cuts, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/joni-ernst-town-hall-00376747">
she replied coldly</a>: “Well, we all are going to die.” Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was 
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mitch-mcconnell-medicaid-cuts-theyll-get-over-it-rcna214953">
similarly dismissive</a>, brushing off concerns by saying “I know a lot of us are hearing from 
people back home about Medicaid. But they’ll get over it.” These callous remarks are no gaffes — 
they’re a glimpse behind the curtain of a party that knows it’s lying and does it anyway.

In the face of this relentless campaign of dishonesty and destruction, I’ve heard a recurring and 
urgent question from my constituents: “What do we do? What can we do?” With that question in mind, 
I hosted a virtual discussion this week with democracy experts to explore tangible ways that each 
of us can push back against anti-democratic forces and work to build a stronger, freer, and more 
inclusive America. If you weren’t able to join us live, I encourage you to check out a recording 
of the conversation on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reppaultonko/videos/1450174879311894">
Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FepML7oXyE&t=10s">YouTube</a> pages — 
because the fight for our democracy begins with each of us choosing to stay engaged and informed.

Authoritarianism and disinformation thrive when people feel powerless. But we are not powerless. 
Our voices, our organizing, and our actions all matter — and now is the time to use every tool at 
our disposal. I’ll continue standing up to the cruelty and lawlessness of this administration. 
And if we all stand together, no lie is too big and no threat is too great to overcome.

As always, thank you for reading.

Your friend,
